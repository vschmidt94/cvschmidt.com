<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

<p>Somehow, someway you’ve found yourself here.</p>

<p>Where is here?</p>

<p>This site is my personal blog. Probably unfit for consumption, but don’t let that stop you.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>I am a software development engineer working for Intel in Folsom, CA. Feel free to check out my C.V. and social profiles
for more details.</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-want-to-blog-but">I don’t want to blog, but…</h2>

<p>That’s right, I don’t <em>_want_</em> to blog.</p>

<p>What having a blog does for me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Organize my thoughts
    <ul>
      <li>By taking the time to post content here, it lets the little gears in my head chew on particular thoughts.</li>
      <li>Commiting ideas to words that might be read by somebody else enforces a certain mental discipline.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Document things I have interest in.</li>
  <li>Improve longer term retention of knowledge
    <ul>
      <li>And provide a digital journal of sorts when I want to refresh on topics that are not always day-to-day</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With this in mind, my target audience here is, well, <em>myself</em>.  If you’ve found <em>yourself</em> here by some means, you are
definitely welcome to stay and make yourself at home. You’ll have to pardon some terrible grammar and spelling at times, 
because I don’t invest a lot in those areas here. But, if there is something useful to you, then great… if not, go
google it and see where it leads.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-codemechanics-">What is code.mechanics ?</h2>

<p>I’m not a big fan of job titles. I’ve graduated with a degrees in mechanical engineering and computer science, and
have held various positions: <em>mechanical systems engineer</em>, <em>software engineer</em>, <em>developer</em>, <em>SDE</em>, etc.</p>

<p>But, what really like doing boils down to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using tools</li>
  <li>Taking things apart</li>
  <li>Putting things back together (hopefully)</li>
  <li>Making things better</li>
  <li>Rolling up my sleeves and getting my hands dirty
All of which describe the classic mechanic working in a shop somewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of my day job, the ‘things’ amount to software code and the infrastructure supporting them. My main hobby
project - which forces me to step away from the keyboard - is restoring a 1966 Mustang convertible. Both require a lot
of the same tools mentally: attention to detail, a willingness to learn, and not being afraid to tear something apart if
it can be improved.</p>
