<h2 id="check-it-out">Check it out!</h2>

<p>Over the summer I recieved an email from Jordan Freeman asking if I would agree to be interviewed for the Oregon State
e-campus online news site. A few weeks later, we were able to connect on a phone call, and I felt like I just talked a
lot - but I think I was able to answer most of his questions.</p>

<p>And now, the end result has been published: <a href="https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/news/2020/building-relationships-with-classmates-was-key-to-success-for-osu-ecampus-alumnus/">Building relationships with classmates was key to success for OSU Ecampus
Alumnus</a></p>

<p>If you’re considering the Oregon State Post-Bacc Computer Science program, I do recommend it. It’s not without it’s
flaws, but I speak from personal experience when I say it can really be life-changing! Feel free reach out to me
directly if needed - I’ll be happy to share my experience.</p>
