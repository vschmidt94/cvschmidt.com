It's been a weekend of distraction, and I was hoping to be well past Day 1 videos.

TBH, I may have to fall back to a book or text of some sort. These youtube videos seem to be overly long and so far have not done much more than install Swift Playground.

I'll keep at it for a little bit longer based on all the positive comments I've read on this series - but hope the pace picks up.
