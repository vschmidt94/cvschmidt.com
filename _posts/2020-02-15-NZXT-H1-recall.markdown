# DevBox / Server down!

The Consumer Safety Product Commission's [NZXT H1 safety recall](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/NZXT-Recalls-H1-Computer-Cases-Due-to-Fire-Hazard) 
hit home this weekend. While I've been aware of the early reports of fire risk and subsequent reporting, I had taken a 
"what are the odds it really happens to me?" approach. But with all the new publicity and reporting, I felt I shouldn't keep
rolling the dice on a potentially damaging fire. I unplugged my sturdy little home server / DevBox and filled out the form
on the NZXT website to request replacement riser parts.

The good news is I recieved a reply quickly - and over the weekend - that a shipping order had been entered to send out
a nylon screw to replace the metal one currently in use in riser card. This is a stop-gap fix until they can fabricate and
dispatch replacement risers that don't have the root cause issue of the PCB ground plane being exposed by the screw hole.

I urge anyone else with the NXZT H1 case to just shut it off, unplug the machine, and file for the repair parts as well.

I really like the form factor - it allows it to be out of the way on the far corner of my desk, and it's run 24/7 since
I built the machine back in August 2019.  For me, it's a home media server running Plex as well as my own personal Linux Dev
machine. But none of that is critical day-to-day - so I'll survive just fine.
