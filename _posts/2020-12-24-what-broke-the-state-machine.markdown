## What is a state machine?

From some software engineering class somewhere, everyone's run into the 
[finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) model. In a state machine,
behavior is controlled by transitioning through a series of states. Upon some logic condition,
the model moves through defined transitions between states.

The software model of a state machine provides a very flexible framework for automation. For example, the movement of
objects between phases in their lifecycle.

## When is a state machine not a state machine?

This is an example I recently ran into
