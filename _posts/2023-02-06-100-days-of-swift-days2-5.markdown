OK, so I missed the forest for the trees or however. Or, I'm just part dumb-ass.

I was following a YouTube playlist, but came to realize 100 Days of SwiftUI has all the videos transcribed on their site, making for a vast speed-up in covering the material.

So, I withdraw my complaint about slow speed - I can process the material at my own pace on https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui


## Things that are sorta interesting

* I do like the strong type checking.
  * After 4 years in largely Python-land, type hints are no substitute for strong type checking
* Introduction to concept like `ReversedCollection` that wraps the base class / collection without having to re-allocate space
* Nice introducing Sets early and mention of speed.
  * I mean Set behavior was anticipated, but goot for the course to mention them early and get new folks thinking in terms of optimizations.
* Enums
  * Better than Pythons's implementation I think, but using `case` is ... odd to me.
  * Like that they are internally stored as primitive
* Constants can be assigned after declaration

OK, that is it for this blog post - I don't want to spend a lot of time doing the 'social media' aspect of the course, but like the idea of it keeps my honest with my own progress.
