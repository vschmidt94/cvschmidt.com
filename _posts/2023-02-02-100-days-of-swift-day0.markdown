# Inspiration

I - just yesterday - realized I may have some opportunity to turn previous experience into 
an opportunity... to develop a specific application used on an iPad.

But what do I know, I've never written a Swift App.

Time to dig in.

# Enter 100 Days of SwiftUI

Sadly, as with many things in life - my first stop on the Swift journey was to check Reddit.
Join r/swift ... check
Read the sidebar of r/swift ... check

Oh, they recommend 100 Days of SwiftUI for beginners ... Interesting.

Check out 100 Days of SwiftUI and watch the intro ... I've been here before, but agree that posting consistent updates
to social media is a good way to self motivate.

# So here we are

So here I am, making my first blog entry to hold myself accountable to my own progress.

Next steps seem to be installing the Swift Playground and on to Lesson #2.

Never stop learning!
