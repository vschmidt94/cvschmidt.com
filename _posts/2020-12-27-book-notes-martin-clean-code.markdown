I want to take another pass through Uncle Bob's (a.k.a. Robert Martin) book, _Clean Code_.

A lot of my work lately has been trending towards overhaul & refactoring legacy modules that have been modified, patched, and
Frakenstein'd for years. This typically starts with a new feature request, which seems simple enough on the surface -
but once I get into the modules in question, some of the accrued technical debt means it's not as simple as it could be.

I want to avoid giving the wrong impression though: I think our particular code base is in fairly average condition
given its age, size, complexity, and number of contributors. It's just time to bring some of the _Boy Scout Rule_
he mentions right in Chapter 1: **Leave the campground better than you found it.**

## Book Notes != Book Review

To be clear, the purpose of this post is a place to collect my own notes as I read through the book. Uncle Bob is going
to explain some things that reasonate with me strongly, and probably there will be things I disagree with as well.

My goal is 1 chapter a every day or two, and I'll just continually update this post until I'm finished. What I hope to
produce in the end is a Cliff Notes-ish post that will be useful for me to circle back to in the future.
