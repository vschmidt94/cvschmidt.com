## Welcome

Somehow, someway you've found yourself here. 

Where is here?

This site is my personal blog. Probably unfit for consumption, but don't let that stop you.

## About me

I am a software development engineer working for Intel in Folsom, CA. Feel free to check out my C.V. and social profiles
for more details.

## I don't want to blog, but...

That's right, I don't *_want_* to blog. 

What having a blog does for me:
* Organize my thoughts
   * By taking the time to post content here, it lets the little gears in my head chew on particular thoughts.
   * Commiting ideas to words that might be read by somebody else enforces a certain mental discipline.
* Document things I have interest in.
* Improve longer term retention of knowledge
   * And provide a digital journal of sorts when I want to refresh on topics that are not always day-to-day

With this in mind, my target audience here is, well, _myself_.  If you've found _yourself_ here by some means, you are
definitely welcome to stay and make yourself at home. You'll have to pardon some terrible grammar and spelling at times, 
because I don't invest a lot in those areas here. But, if there is something useful to you, then great... if not, go
google it and see where it leads.

## What is code.mechanics ?

I'm not a big fan of job titles. I've graduated with a degrees in mechanical engineering and computer science, and
have held various positions: _mechanical systems engineer_, _software engineer_, _developer_, _SDE_, etc.

But, what really like doing boils down to:
* Using tools
* Taking things apart
* Putting things back together (hopefully)
* Making things better
* Rolling up my sleeves and getting my hands dirty
All of which describe the classic mechanic working in a shop somewhere.

In the case of my day job, the 'things' amount to software code and the infrastructure supporting them. My main hobby
project - which forces me to step away from the keyboard - is restoring a 1966 Mustang convertible. Both require a lot
of the same tools mentally: attention to detail, a willingness to learn, and not being afraid to tear something apart if
it can be improved.
