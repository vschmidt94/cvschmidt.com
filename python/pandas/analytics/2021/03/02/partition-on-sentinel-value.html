<h1 id="the-problem">The problem</h1>

<p>I have a collection of sensor readings / telemetry that I want to partition into subsets based on the detection
of a sentinel value. For this case, imagine a collection of power readings for a motor running a conveyor
belt in a factory. When a batch is being produced, the conveyor belt runs continuously. The belt motor
is powered off during process change-overs.</p>

<p>The motor drive is polled once per minute and instantaneous power draw is saved to database along with
other metrics from elsewhere in the process.</p>

<p>It is easier to show than explainâ€¦
