# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

    Welcome to my personal blog... these are probably not the droids you are looking for,
    but welcome! This is a space I use to organize my thoughts, track projects and ideas,
    and discuss topics of interest. Usually (but not always) about software development
    topics.

url: "http://vschmidt94.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
